## Project Name
asyncPromises Projects
## About
A collection of JavaScript projects exploring asynchronous programming concepts using Promises and async/await. This repository demonstrates handling asynchronous operations, such as API simulations, delays, and error handling, to build foundational skills in modern JavaScript for real-world applications like web development and data fetching.
## Prerequisites
To run this project you need JavaScript installed on your system.
Node.js is recommended for executing the examples locally.
No additional libraries or packages are required.
## Features
This asyncPromises includes these features:

* Implementation of basic Promises for simulating asynchronous tasks (e.g., timers, data fetching).
* Usage of async/await syntax for cleaner, more readable asynchronous code.
* Error handling with try/catch blocks and .catch() methods.
* Example scripts showing chaining Promises and parallel execution with Promise.all().
* Modular structure with reusable async functions.

## Getting Started & Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/asyncPromises.git`
## Usage
Open the repository in your preferred code editor.
Navigate to the example files (e.g., promise-basics.js or async-await-example.js).
Run the files using Node.js:
node promise-basics.js
Review the console output to see asynchronous operations in action, including resolved promises, awaited results, and error scenarios.
Modify the scripts to experiment with your own async functions.
## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:

* Understand the event loop and how JavaScript handles asynchronicity.
* Differentiate between callbacks, Promises, and async/await patterns.
* Implement proper error handling in asynchronous code.
* Practice chaining and composing asynchronous operations for efficient programming.
* Gain confidence in using modern JavaScript features for scalable applications.
## Contributing
This is primarily a personal learning / portfolio repository, so formal contributions aren’t required. However, if you spot bugs, have project ideas, or want to add improvements, feel free to:
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch
3. Submit a pull request Please include clear explanations of your changes and test any new code.
## License
This repository is open and free for educational use.
*(If you decide on a specific license later, insert it here — e.g. MIT, Apache 2.0, etc.)*
